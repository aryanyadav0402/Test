Mouse,What kind of mouse can I buy?,"There are many types of computer mouse and trackball designs on the market today. From mice designed with ergonomics in mind to lightning-fast gaming mice and standard USB mice for daily computing activities, there is a mouse to fit your needs. Consider the types of daily tasks you do to narrow down the best mouse for your own computing needs. Some types of mouse available you can buy now are wired mouse, wireless mouse and bluetooth mouse."
Mouse,"What are the differences between wired mouse, wireless mouse and bluetooth mouse?","While a wired mouse is powered by the connection to the PC, a wireless mouse usually requires charging or batteries to operate. But wireless mice also offer greater freedom and connectivity from across rooms and can often work on surfaces other than mouse pads, making them ideal for presentations or when you need to stand away from the screen but have control over the display. Most wireless mice models use a dongle that connects to your PC, and the mouse communicates back and forth in that manner. A Bluetooth mouse, however, utilizes an internal Bluetooth connection on your PC, allowing you to connect the mouse to multiple devices at a time."
Mouse,What is the difference between a gaming and non gaming mouse?,"Gaming mice are special mice that are more suited to gaming than regular mice. A gaming mouse is different from a normal mouse because it has more buttons and a different shape. Gaming mice can be either wired or wireless, with the latter being more common. The most important difference between a gaming mouse and a regular mouse is that the gamer will see what his/her character is doing in real time (the same way he/she sees his/her movements in real life). Due to this feature, gamers tend to use their hands less often and prefer using their eyes instead. In fact, most use macros so that they don't need to move their hands at all."
Mouse,Does a mouse need some sort of mousepad to function?,"If your mouse works without one and you can use it comfortably, then no you don’t. But if you feel discomfort, pain or the mouse doesn’t precisely respond to movement input (or doesn’t respond at all), you might want to consider buying a mouse pad. There are many different shapes and designs, such as speed type, control type and hard pads."
Mouse,"What is the difference between speed, control and hard mouse pads?","Hard pads, like most other mice pads on the market, have a rubber base that prevents the pad from slipping when you’re using it during high intensity situations. Hard pads are easier to clean than that of cloth pads and for games that rely on quick snappy movement a hard pad can make you excel. Control pads have a more coarse or grainy feel giving you more control over your mouse movement. This can come in handy when playing a precision based FPS game and you need to make sure that your aim is on point all the time. A speed pad has a soft, smooth fabric surface for your mouse and has the same rubber under the belly so it doesn't slip and slide around your desk. Speed pads offer the same incredible tracking and precision that a hard pad or a control pad can offer but with a little less resistance when swiping your mouse around quickly."
Mouse,What are some features of modern gaming mice?,"A gaming mouse has certain characteristics, like high dpi setting, extra macro keys, and multi-key toggle and high polling rate etc. DPI (dots per inch) is the measure of how far a mouse cursor moves on screen for specific lengths of mouse movements (technically sensitivity of the mouse) . Higher the DPI, higher the sensitivity of the mouse will be. And most gaming mice have a higher DPI range one can choose from. Macro keys are extra keys on the mouse which enable the user to allot various in-game functions to those keys like reload gun, melee, and interact. Multi-key toggle, helps the mouse send multiple commands to the computer when clicking multiple keys at the same time. So, enabling faster, quicker and multiple action during gaming sessions. Polling rate, it is the rate at which a mouse relays information to the computer. It is measured in Hertz (Hz) and higher the value, lower will be lag, and greater will be the response."
Mouse,Do Wireless Mice Have Delay?,"When you use a wireless mouse on your computer for the first time, or the first few times, you will likely notice that there is a lag, and the cursor does not move as quickly as it does with your wired mouse. There are ways that you can prevent this lag from happening and you can continue to use your wireless mouse if it suits you better than a wired one. You can download the proper wireless mouse driver from the manufacturer’s website to make sure you have the latest version available. You can also try to change the frequency of your mouse. If the speed of your mouse is set to slow, you will want to change it to medium or fast. Doing either or both of these will get rid of the lag completely and you will be able to continue using your wireless mouse with no delay."
Mouse,Are wired mice cheaper than wireless ones?,Wireless gaming mice are always more expensive than wired versions of the same mouse. The higher cost is inevitable considering the advanced technology. Transmitters and extension cables also add to the price of wireless mice.
Mouse,What type of mouse is best suited for office work? ,"There's plenty to look into when you're shopping for the best work mouse for your needs, but I suggest you start by looking at ergonomics first. Even minor differences in the size, shape, and overall design of your mouse can help you work more comfortably for longer. Second, consider the kind of work you'll be doing and determine what features you may need to improve your workflow. If you work with documents and spreadsheets, you'll want a high-quality scroll wheel. If you're a programmer or design professional, it's helpful to have a good number of easy-to-reach, programmable buttons for macros. Some other elements you'll want to keep in mind are whether you'd like wireless capabilities, multi-device pairing, or if you have a preference for how you recharge your mouse. Also, you may want a more compact and portable model if you're planning on using your mouse on the go."
Mouse,What type of mouse is best suited for gaming? ,"The best gaming mouse you could buy this year is completely dependent on your needs as well as the games that you play. There are a few distinct subdivisions of gaming mice that we can take a look at, most of which have button designs and placements meant to aid in very specific types of games. Note that these subdivisions are independent of the body and grip styles mentioned above—a shooter mouse can be wide and low for a palm grip or skinny and shallow for a tip grip. So once you decide what type of gaming mouse to buy, be sure to look at recommendations with grip type and software in mind."
Mouse,"Which one is better, mouse or trackpad?","If you have the space for it, a mouse is better for productivity. It might not be the best choice at first, but with practice, you’ll have fast mouse movement and incredible precision that can speed up everything you do on your computer. However, if you’re the kind that works whilst travelling, or you’ve built a habit where you’re constantly picking up and moving the laptop around at home, a trackpad may be more convenient than a mouse simply because you’re not forced to carry it around and plug it in constantly. A mouse on a nice, flat surface with a good mouse pad underneath will be the best choice when working from a simple, static location, but in less optimal conditions, like working in an airport chair, a trackpad will always win."
Mouse,Is it hard to play PC games on a laptop trackpad?,"Yes, it is hard to play PC games on a laptop trackpad because trackpads were not designed for gaming. They are an aide to people who are unable to carry a mouse with them all the time. In my opinion, it is a much slower and inferior alternative to using a mouse; or even a keyboard. It is only recommended for busy executives who spend more time running from one meeting to another than actually preparing for them. These type of people are usually presenting something on their laptop, e.g. powerpoints or excel documents, instead of sitting down and creating them. The trackpad is slow, not intuitive at all, and totally unsuitable for any kind of gaming; be it an FPS, and RTS or an RPG."
Mouse,What is the average price for a good gaming mouse?,"The best budget mouse for gaming depends on how much you're willing to spend. The high-end choices which are popular and trending cost anywhere from $45-50, while the most affordable options might cost you as low as $20-30."
Mouse,What is DPI in a gaming mouse?,"DPI stands for dots per inch or in gaming terms, pixels per inch. DPI determines how far a cursor moves per inch of mouse movement. 400 DPI = 1 inch mouse movement, moves the cursor 400 pixels. The lower the DPI, the less sensitive your mouse."
Mouse,What are the advantages of having high DPI setting in a gaming mouse?,"Simply put, a higher DPI makes a huge difference. Most gaming mice check how far they've moved around 1,000 times a second, also called a polling rate. If a player is using a DPI lower than than the number of times the mouse checks for movement, they're leaving performance and accuracy on the table."
Mouse,Should I buy a mouse with braided cable?,"Non-braided cables tend to have a mind of their own and get in the way more often, whereas the braided ones (sometimes) lay more naturally where you put them without the pre-kinked bends making them less of a nuisance to use. A good braided mouse cable is more of a factor, but if the gauge of wire used in the mouse is too large then the braided external housing is basically useless."
Laptop,What is an Ultrabook?,"An ultrabook is a high-end laptop, sleek in design but uncompromising in performance. The term ultrabook was coined by Intel, and the market continues to be dominated by devices containing Intel Core processors which give ultrabooks impressive performance power. Despite their slight frame, they have the capabilities of larger, bulkier laptops and some desktops. Ultrabooks are interesting creatures, as they cover a wide range of uses, have screen sizes that range from 13 to 15 or even 17 inches, and cover broad price ranges.
Originally surfacing in 2011, ultrabooks redefined the laptop market by impressing consumers with their stylish, lightweight design. Today, ultrabooks continue to dominate the laptop market, as the easiest portability becomes increasingly important to users.
Since their inception, ultrabooks have become more impressive in their performance capabilities. When the first ultrabook surfaced, the device ran the Huron River platform, which consisted of between 2 to 4 GB RAM capacity, a relatively short five-hour battery life, and between a 1.5 to 1.7 gHz processor. Since then, major improvements have been made to the platform. Ultrabooks now run the Chief River platform, which boast more powerful processors."
Laptop,What is the difference between a laptop and a tablet?,"A laptop is generally characterized as a mobile personal computer -- a device on which you can perform all the tasks available on a desktop but in a mobile, light, compact fashion. Laptops have become lighter and smaller over the years, but have made significant strides in power, functionality and performance. For many users, laptops have become their preferred computing device because it allows them to complete all the tasks they would need on a desktop but with the convenience of mobility and flexibility.
Tablets, on the other hand, are currently the pinnacle of mobile technology. They are compact, very lightweight and extremely easy to carry. However, they do not possess the processing power of a laptop. Their functionality as a computing device is very limited, although sufficient for some people’s uses. Tablets can be ideal for those who browse the Web casually, such as read the news or popular websites, and those who play ""lightweight"" games, or want to watch TV or films while traveling. Additionally, tablets can be used in a variety of specialized careers like design and music."
Laptop,"What should I look out for when purchasing a used laptop or computer?","First and foremost, look to see who the warranty is from (if there is indeed a warranty package offered). If there's no warranty, don't buy the computer. If the warranty is from a third-party retailer, look very carefully at the specifications of the coverage. Better yet, don't buy it: Third-party retailers often lack the expertise or resources to make their coverage worthwhile. This has given many buyers an unfortunate false sense of security.

If the warranty is from the manufacturer, as always, you should be careful you know what the warranty specifies. But manufacturers may be able to come through where a third-party retailer cannot.
If you aren't buying the laptop from an online retailer and can see it in person, check everything you can. Examine the screen (one of the most expensive parts of the laptop), the keyboard, the USB ports, the CD/DVD drive, the audio output and input, the Ethernet port and the battery's life and accessibility. Batteries are one of the first things that need to be replaced on used laptops, and if you can't access the battery, you can't replace it.
It's often difficult to access a laptop's user history and even tougher to verify it. If you do choose to buy a used laptop, it might be extremely helpful to have a computer technician or expert run a complete diagnostic scan of your computer immediately upon purchase. A professional might see what you can't."
Laptop,"What is a 2-in-1 Laptop?","A 2-in-1 laptop is a device that provides the user experience of a tablet with the computing power, software compatibility, and overall characteristics of a laptop. A 2-in-1 tablet incorporate features of a laptop like a physical keyboard, large display and ample built-in storage.
Devices like the ThinkPad Yoga are designed as tablets that can be used as laptops. The keyboard can be folded away if desired, and the user can interact with the OS via the device's touchscreen interface. However, if more traditional computing needs are desired, the device can be positioned on a dock and a physical keyboard and Bluetooth mouse can be used, providing a desktop user experience."
Laptop,"What is Cloud computing?",")The ""cloud"" is a set of different types of hardware and software that work collectively to deliver many aspects of computing to the end-user as an online service.
Cloud Computing is the use of hardware and software to deliver a service over a network (typically the Internet). With cloud computing, users can access files and use applications from any device that can access the Internet.
An example of a Cloud Computing provider is Google's Gmail. Gmail users can access files and applications hosted by Google via the internet from any device."
Laptop,"What is a Chromebook?","Many people assume that when it comes to buying a laptop, there are only two choices: Windows PC or Mac. But there is another option – the Chromebook.
So what are Chromebooks, exactly? In some ways, a Chromebook is a standard laptop – you can use it for creating documents, accessing the Internet, and communicating via email and video conference, just as you would on a Windows device or Mac. But in other ways, it's an entirely new kind of portable device. In fact, you could say that it's a laptop that redefines what a laptop can be.

Running Google's Chrome operating system, and calling upon Google applications on the Cloud, such as Google Docs, Google Sheets, and more, the Chromebook is a lean and focused machine that isn't dependent on software stored on the hard drive. Simple and secure, the Chromebook makes getting things done in and out of the classroom or work environment quick, easy, and affordable.
Perhaps best of all, setup on a Chromebook can be completed in mere minutes. Plug in, turn it on, and you'll be up and running in no time! If you're in the market for a new laptop, consider Chromebook."
Laptop,"Chromebook vs Laptop: Which is Better for Me?","If you are asking yourself which is better, Chromebook or laptop, it's important to realize that both machines offer a number of benefits. Ultimately, which device is right for you will depend on your needs. Many people find that Chromebooks offer everything that they are looking for in a package that is affordable, robust, and convenient – you may discover the same thing.
One of the aspects that clearly distinguishes Chromebooks from traditional laptops is that they make extensive use of the Cloud. A Chromebook is primarily intended to be used while connected to the Internet, as many of the device's applications are Cloud-based. The benefit of this approach is that these software applications do not have to be stored or run off of the device's built-in hard drive. This helps improve performance and speed, while freeing up storage space. However, internet connectivity is required for utilizing the majority of Chromebook functionality. So if you know you need to use applications without internet access, a laptop may be a better fit for you.
The ThinkPad 11e Series features both laptops and Chromebooks that boast impressive specs including ultra-efficient Intel Celeron processors, standard HD displays, extra reinforcement inside and out for added durability, and battery life that can get you through the day. Lenovo also offers a Chromebook Series engineered for value and efficiency. Comparing similar laptop and Chromebook models may help you decide which is right for you."
